# "Create a simple Contact Book app" challenge by reactpractice.dev 

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

- Days eighteen and nineteen of the challenge, this time doing a typewriter effect component!
- This was cool in a way I had to think the implementation carefuly, but overall it felt short and smaller-scope compared to the others
- Copied the main branch of the repo provided by the challenge, so I could avoid looking at the solution in the another branch!
- Didn't expanded upon the UI due to the task being a simple one
- Added a couple extras regarding disabling the button and the input during typing

**NOTE:** most boring one so far, and quite simple for being so far ahead in the challenge... But I won't say more, because I feel the next one is gonna be very hard!
